3.5.2 (2006.07.31)
===================
  o  Speed-up and improvement on Windows console:
     - Support DirectSound for better input handling
     - Support input threading utilizing callback API on portaudio.
     - Support newest MinGW (tested on 5.0.2)

  o  More accurate word graph output:
     - Add option to cut the resulting graph by its depth
       (option -graphcut, and enabled by default!)
     - Set limit for post-processing loop to avoid infinite loop
       (option -graphboundloop, and set by default)
     - Refine graph generation algorithm concerning dynamic word merging
       and search termination on the second pass.

  o  Add capability to output word graph instead of trellis on 1st pass:
     - 1st pass generates word graph instead of word trellis as
       intermediate result by specifying "--enable-word-graph".
       In that case, the 2nd pass will be restricted on the graph, not
       on the whole trellis.
     - With "--enable-word-graph" and "--enable-wpair" option, the
       first pass of Julius can perform 1-pass graph generation based
       on 2-gram with basically the same algorithm as other popular
       word graph based decoders.

  o  Bug fixes:
     - configure script did not work on Solaris 8/9
     - "-gprune none" did not work on tied-mixture AM
     - Incorrect error message for AM with duration header other than "NULLD"
     - Always warns abount zero frame stripping upon MFCC

  o  Imprementation improvements:
     - bmalloc2-based AM memory management


3.5.1 (2006.03.31)
===================
  o  Wider MFCC types support:
     - Added extraction of acceleration coefficients (_A).  Now you
       can recognize waveform or microphone input with AM trained with _A.
     - Support all MFCC qualifiers (_0, _E, _N, _D, _A, _N, _Z) and their
       combination 
     - Support for any vector lenth (will be guessed from AM header)
     - New option: "-accwin"
     - New option "-zmeanframe": frame-wise DC offset removal, like HTK
     - New options to specify detailed analysis parameters (see manual):
          -preemph, -fbank, -ceplif, -rawe / -norawe, 
          -enormal / -noenormal, -escale, -silfloor

  o Improved microphone / network recognition by MAP-CMN:
     - New option "-cmnmapweight" to change MAP weight
     - Option "-cmnload" can be used to specify the initial cepstral
       mean at startup
     - Cepstral mean of last 5 second input is used as an initial mean
       for each input.  You can inhibit updating of the initial mean
       and keep the value loaded by "-cmnload" by option "-cmnnoupdate".

  o Module issue:
     - Julius now outputs "<STARTPROC/>" when recognition starts, and
       "<STOPPROC/>" after recognition stopped by module command.
       Use this for safer server-client synchronization.
     - now can specify grammar name from client by specifying a name
       after a command like "ADDGRAM name" or "CHANGEGRAM name".

  o Bug fixes:
     - Sometimes segfault on pause/resume command on module mode while input.
     - Can not read N-gram with tuples > 2^24.
     - Can not read HMM with 3-state (1 output state) model on multi-path.
     - Sometimes omit the last transition definition in DFA file.
     - Sometimes fails to compile the gramtools on MacOSX.


3.5 (2005.11.11)
=================
  o  New features:
     - Input verification / rejection using GMM (-gmm, -gmmnum, -gmmreject)
     - Word graph output (--enable-graphout, --enable-graphout-nbest)
     - Pruning on 2nd pass based on local posterior CM (--enable-cmthres)
     - Multiple/per-grammar recognition (-gram, -gramlist, -multigramout) 
     - Can specify multiple grammars at startup: "-gram prefix1,prefix2,..."
       or "-gramlist listfile" where listfile contains list of prefixes.
     - General output character set conversion "-charconv from to"
       based on iconv (Linux) or Win32API+libjcode (Windows)

  o  Improved audio inputs on Linux:
     - ALSA-1.x support. (--with-mictype=alsa)
     - EsounD daemon input support. (--with-mictype=esd)
     - Fixed some bugs on USB audio input.
     - Audio capturing device can be specified via env. "AUDIODEV".
     - Extra microphone API support using portaudio and spLib API.

  o  Performance improvements:
     - Reduced memory size for beam operation on the 1st pass.
     - Slightly optimized tree lexicon by removing redundant data.
     - Reduced size of word N-gram index (reduced from 32 bit to 24 bit).

  o  Fixed bugs:
     - Not working spectral subtraction.
     - Memory leak when stack exhausted ("stack empty") on 2nd pass.
     - Segmentation fault on a very short input of 1 to 4 frames.
     - AM trained with no CMN cannot be used with waveform/mic input.
     - Wrong short-pause word handling on successive decoding mode.
       (--enable-sp-segment)
     - No output of "maxcodebooksize" at startup.
     - No output of the number of sentences found when stack exhausted.
     - No output of "-separatescore" on module mode.
     - Beam width does not adjusted when grammar has been changed and 
       full beam options (-b 0) is specified in Julian.
     - Wrong update of category-aware cross-word triphones when
       dynamically switching grammar on Julian.
     - No output of grammar to stdout on multiple grammar mode.
     - Unable to send/receive audio data between different endian machines.
     - (Linux) crash when compiled with icc.
     - (Linux) some strange behavior on USB audio.
     - (Windows) confuse with CR/LF newline inputs in several text inputs.
     - (Windows) mkdfa.pl could not work on cygwin.
     - (Windows) sometimes fails to read a file when not using zlib.
     - (Windows) wrong file suffix when recording with "-record" (.raw->.wav)

  o  Unified source code:
     - Linux and Windows version are integrated into one source.
     - Multi-path version has been integrated with the normal version
       into one source.  The multi-path version of Julius/Julian, that
       allows any transitions of HMMs including model skip transition,
       can be compiled by "--enable-multipath" option.  The part of
       source codes for the multi-path version can be identified 
       by the definition "MULTIPATH_VERSION".

  o  Other improvements:
     - Now can be compiled on MinGW/MSYS on Windows
     - Totally rewritten comments in entire source in Doxygen format.
       You can generate fully browsable source documents in English.
       Try "make doxygen" at the top directory (you need doxygen installed)
     - Install additional executables of julius/julian with version and setting
       names like "julius-3.5-fast" when "make install" is invoked.
     - Updated LICENSE.txt with English translation for reference.

  o  Changed behaviors:
     - Binary N-gram file format has been changed for smaller size.
       The old files can still be read directly by julius, in which
       case on-line conversion will be performed at startup.
       You can convert the old files (3.4.2 and earlier) to the new
       format with the new mkbingram by involing the command below:
	       "mkbingram -d oldbinary newbinary"
       Please note that since mkbingram now output the new format
       file, it can not be read by older Julius.
       The binary N-gram file version can be detected by the first 17
       bytes of the file: old format should be "julius_bingram_v3" and
       new format should be "julius_bingram_v4".
     - Byte order of audio stream via tcpip fixed to LITTLE ENDIAN.
     - Now use built-in zlib by default for compressed files.  This may
       make the engine startup slower, and if you prefer, you can still
       use the previous method using external gzip command by specifying
       "--disable-zlib".
     - (Windows) Changed the compilation procedure on VC++.  You can build
       Julian by only specifying "-DBUILD_JULIAN" at compiler option,
       and do not need to alter "julius.h".

- MFCC computation becomes faster by sin/cos table lookup.
- Bugs below have been fixed:
  - (-input adinnet) recognition does not start immediately after speech
		     inputs begin when using adinnet client.
  - (-input adinnet) together with module mode, speech input cannot
		     stop by pause/terminate command.
  - (-input adinnet) unneccesary fork when connecting with adinnet client.
  - (-input rawfile) error in reading wave files created by Windows
                     sound recorder.

===================
- Fixes for audio input:
  - Fix segfault/hangup with continuous microphone input.
  - Fix client hangup when input speech too long in module mode.
    (now send an buffer overflow message to the client)
  - Fix audio input buffering for very short input (<1000 samples).
  - Fix blocking handling in tcpip adin.
- Some cosmetic changes (jcontrol, LOG_TEN, etc.)

3.3p3 (2003.01.08)
===================
- New inter-word short pause handling:
  - [Julius] New option added for short pause handling.  Specifying
    "-iwspword" adds a short-pause word entry, namely "<UNK> [sp] sp sp",
    to the dictionary.  The entry content to be changed by using "-iwspentry".
  - [multi-path] Supports inter-word context-free short pause handling.
    "-iwsp" option automatically appends a skippable short pause model at
    every word end.  The added model will also be ignored in context
    modeling.  The short pause model to be appended by "-iwsp" can be
    specified by "-spmodel" options.  See documents for details.
- Fixes for audio input:
   - Input delay improved: the initial response to mic input now
     becomes much faster than previous versions (200ms -> 50ms approx.).
   - Would not block when other process is using the audio device, but
     just output error and exit.
   - Update support for libsndfile-1.0.x.
   - Update support for ALSA-0.9.x 
     (to use this, add "--with-mictype=alsa" to configure option.)

  this version, you can use "any" type of state transition in HTK
  format acoustic model.
- New feature: "-record dir" records speech inputs sucessively
  into the specified directory with time-stamp file names.
- fix segfault on Solaris with "-input mfcfile".
- fix blocking command input when using module mode and adinnet together.
