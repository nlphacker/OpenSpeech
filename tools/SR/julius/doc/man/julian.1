.SH NAME
Julian - grammar based continuous speech recognition parser
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B julian [-C jconffile] [options ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Julian
is a high-performance, multi-purpose, free speech recognition parser
based on finite state grammar.  It is capable of performing real-time
recognition of continuous speech with over thousands of vocabulary.
.PP
.I Julian
is a derived version of 
.I Julius,
and almost all components are the same except language model related
part.  
.PP
To execute a recognition, it needs an acoustic model and a finite
state grammar that describes sentence patterns to be recognized.
The grammar format is an original one, and
tools to create a recognirion grammar are included in the
distribution.  For acoustic model, standard format (i.e. HTK) with any
word/phone units and sizes are supported.  So users can build a
recognition system customized for specific tasks using own task
grammar and acoustic models.  For details about models and how to
write a grammar, please see the documents contained in this package.
.PP
.I Julian
can perform recognition on audio files, live microphone input,
network input and feature parameter files.  The maximum size of
vocabulary is 65,535 words.
.SH "RECOGNITION MODELS"
.I Julian
supports the following models.
.Ip "Acoustic Models" 10
Same as Julius: Sub-word HMM (Hidden Markov Model) in HTK format are
supported.  Phoneme models (monophone), context dependent phoneme
models (triphone), tied-mixture and phonetic tied-mixture models of
any unit can be used.  When using context dependent models, interword
context is also handled.  You can further use a tool
.I mkbinhmm
to convert the ascii HMM definition file to binary format, for
speeding up the startup (this format is incompatible with that of HTK).
.Ip "Language model" 10
The grammar format is an original one, and tools to create a
recognirion grammar are included in the distribution.  A grammar
consists of two files: one is a 'grammar' file that describes sentence
structures in a BNF style, using word 'categories' as terminate symbols.
Another is a 'voca' file that defines word with its pronunciations
(i.e. phoneme sequences) for each category.  They should be converted by
mkdfa.pl(1) to a deterministic finite automaton file (.dfa) and a
dictionary file (.dict), respectively.
.SH SPEECH INPUT
Same as Julius: Both live speech input and recorded speech file input
are supported. Live input stream from microphone device, DatLink
(NetAudio) device and tcpip network input using 
.I adintool
is supported.  Speech waveform files (16bit WAV (no compression),
RAW format, and many other format will be acceptable if compiled with 
.I libsndfile
library).  Feature parameter files in HTK format are also
supported.
.PP
Note that 
.I Julian
itself can only extract MFCC_E_D_N_Z features from speech data.
If you use an acoustic HMM trained by other feature type, only the
HTK parameter file of the same feature type can be used.
.SH "SEARCH ALGORITHM OVERVIEW"
Recognition algorithm of
.I Julian
is based on a two-pass strategy.  In the first pass, a high-speed
approximate search is performed using weaker constraints then the
given grammar.  Here a LR beam search using only inter-category
constraints extracted from the grammar is performed. The second pass
re-searches the input, using the original grammar rules and
intermediate results from the first pass, to gain a high precision
result quickly.  In the second pass the optimal solution is
theoretically guaranteed using the A* search.
.PP
When using context dependent phones (triphones), interword contexts
are taken into consideration.  For tied-mixture and phonetic
tied-mixture models, high-speed acoustic likelihood calculation is
possible using gaussian pruning.
.PP
For more details, see the related document or web page below.
.SH "OPTIONS"
The options below specify the models, system behaviors and various
search parameters.  These option can be set all at once at the command
line, but it is recommended that you write them in a text file as a
"jconf file", and specify the file with "-C" option.
.PP
Most are the same as Julius.
.br
Options only in Julian: -gram, -gramlist, -dfa, -penalty1, -penalty2, -looktrellis
.br
Options only in Julius: -nlr, -nrl, -d, -lmp, -lmp2, -transp,
-silhead, -siltail, -spdur, -sepnum, -separatescore
.PP
.SS Speech Input
.Ip "-input {rawfile|mfcfile|mic|adinnet|netaudio|stdin}"
Select speech data input source.  'rawfile' is waveform file, and
'mfcfile' is HTK format parametera file.  These file names should be
specified after startup from stdin).  'mic' means microphone device,
and 'adinnet' means receiving waveform data via tcpip network from an
adinnet client. 'netaudio' is from DatLink/NetAudio input, and 'stdin'
means data input from standard input.
.sp
WAV (no compression) and RAW (noheader, 16bit, BigEndian) are
supported for waveform file input.  Other format can be supported
using external library.  To see what format is actually supported, see
the help message using option "-help".  For stdin input, only WAV and
RAW is supported.
.br
(default: mfcfile)
.Ip "\-filelist file"
(With -input rawfile|mfcfile) perform recognition on all files listed
in the file.
.Ip "\-adport portnum"
(with -input adinnet) adinnet port number (default: 5530)
.Ip "\-NA server:unit"
(with -input netaudio) set the server name and unit ID of the Datlink
unit.
.Ip "\-zmean  \-nozmean"
This option enables/disables DC offset removal of input waveform.
For speech file input, zero mean will be computed from the whole input.
For microphone / network input, zero mean of the first 48000 samples
(3 seconds in 16kHz sampling) will be used at the rest.  (default:
disabled (-nozmean))
.Ip "\-zmeanframe  \-nozmeanframe"
With speech input, this option enables/disables frame-wise DC offset
removal. This is the same as HTK's ZMEANSOURCE option, and cannot be
set with "\-zmean".  (default: disabled (-nozmeanframe))
.Ip "\-nostrip"
Julian by default removes zero samples in input speech data.  In some
cases, such invalid data may be recorded at the start or end of
recording.  This option inhibit this automatic removal.
.Ip "\-record directory"
Auto-save input speech data successively under the directory.  Each
segmented inputs are recorded to a file each by one.  The file name of
the recorded data is generated from system time when the input starts,
in a style of "YYYY.MMDD.HHMMSS.wav".  File format is 16bit monoral
WAV.  Invalid for mfcfile input.  With input rejection by "-rejectshort",
the rejected input will also be recorded even if they are rejected.
.Ip "\-rejectshort msec"
Reject input shorter than specified milliseconds.  Search will be
terminated and no result will be output.  In module mode, '<REJECTED
REASON="..."/>' message will be sent to client.  With "-record", the
rejected input will also be recorded even if they are rejected. 
(default: 0 = off)
.SS Speech Detection
Options in this section is invalid for mfcfile input.
.Ip "\-cutsilence"
.Ip "\-nocutsilence"
Force silence cutting (=speech segment detection) to ON/OFF. (default: ON
for mic/adinnet, OFF for files)
.Ip "\-lv threslevel"
Level threshold (0 - 32767) for speech triggering.  If audio input
amplitude goes over this threshold for a period, Julius begin the 1st
pass recognition.  If the level goes below this level after
triggering, it is the end of the speech segment. (default: 2000)
.Ip "\-zc zerocrossnum"
Zero crossing threshold per a second (default: 60)
.Ip "\-headmargin msec"
Margin at the start of the speech segment in milliseconds. (default: 300)
.Ip "\-tailmargin msec"
Margin at the end of the speech segment in milliseconds. (default: 400)
.SS Acoustic Analysis
.Ip "\-smpFreq frequency"
Set sampling frequency of input speech in Hz.  Sampling rate can also
be specified using "\-smpPeriod".  Be careful that this frequency
should be the same as the trained conditions of acoustic model you use.
This should be specified for microphone input and RAW file input
when using other than default rate.  Also see "\-fsize", "\-fshift",
"\-delwin" and "\-accwin".
.br
(default: 16000 (Hz = 625ns))
.Ip "\-smpPeriod period"
Set sampling frequency of input speech by its sampling period
(nanoseconds).  The sampling rate can also be specified using
"\-smpFreq".  Be careful that the input frequency should be the same
as the trained conditions of acoustic model you use. This should be
specified for microphone input and RAW file input when using other
than default rate.  Also see "\-fsize", "\-fshift", "\-delwin" and "\-accwin".
.br
(default: 625 (ns = 16000Hz))
.Ip "\-fsize sample"
Analysis window size in number of samples. (default: 400).
.Ip "\-fshift sample"
Frame shift in number of samples (default: 160).
.Ip "\-preemph value"
Pre-emphasis coefficient (default: 0.97)
.Ip "\-fbank num"
Number of filterbank channels (default: 24)
.Ip "\-ceplif num"
Cepstral liftering coefficient (default: 22)
.Ip "\-rawe / \-norawe"
Enable/disable using raw energy before pre-emphasis (default: disabled)
.Ip "\-enormal / \-nornormal"
Enable/disable normalizing log energy (default: disabled).
Note: normalising log energy should not be specified on live input, at
both training and recognition (see sec. 5.9 "Direct Audio
Input/Output" in HTKBook).
.Ip "\-escale value"
Scaling factor of log energy when normalizing log energy (default: 1.0)
.Ip "\-silfloor value"
Energy silence floor in dB when normalizing log energy (default: 50.0)
.Ip "\-delwin frame"
Delta window size in number of frames (default: 2).
.Ip "\-accwin frame"
Acceleration window size in number of frames (default: 2).
.Ip "\-lofreq frequency"
Enable band-limiting for MFCC filterbank computation: set lower
frequency cut-off.
.br
(default: -1 = disabled)
.Ip "\-hifreq frequency"
Enable band-limiting for MFCC filterbank computation: set upper
frequency cut-off.
.br
(default: -1 = disabled)
.Ip "\-sscalc"
Perform spectral subtraction using head part of each file.  With this
option, Julius assume there are certain length of silence at each
input file.  Valid only for rawfile input.  Conflict with "\-ssload".
.Ip "\-sscalclen"
With "\-sscalc", specify the length of head part silence in
milliseconds (default: 300)
.Ip "\-ssload filename"
Perform spectral subtraction for speech input using pre-estimated
noise spectrum from file.  The noise spectrum data should be computed
beforehand by 
.I mkss.
Valid for all speech input.  Conflict with "\-sscalc".
.Ip "\-ssalpha value"
Alpha coefficient of spectral subtraction.  Noise will be subtracted
stronger as this value gets larger, but distortion of the resulting
signal also becomes remarkable.  (default: 2.0)
.Ip "\-ssfloor value"
Flooring coefficient of spectral subtraction.  The spectral parameters
that go under zero after subtraction will be substituted by the source
signal with this coefficient multiplied. (default: 0.5)
.SS GMM-based Input Verification and Rejection
.Ip "\-gmm filename"
GMM definition file in HTK format. If specified, GMM-based input 
verification will be performed concurrently with the 1st pass, and
you can reject the input according to the result as specified by
"-gmmreject".  Note that the GMM should be defined as one-state HMMs,
and their training parameter should be the same as the acoustic model
you want to use with.
.Ip "\-gmmnum N"
Number of Gaussian components to be computed per frame on GMM
calculation.  Only the N-best Gaussians will be computed for rapid
calculation.  The default is 10 and specifying smaller value will
speed up GMM calculation, but too small value (1 or 2) may cause
degradation of identification performance.
.Ip "\-gmmreject string"
Comma-separated list of GMM names to be rejected as invalid input.
When recognition, the log likelihoods of GMMs accumulated for the
entire input will be computed concurrently with the 1st pass.  If
the GMM name of the maximum score is within this string, the 2nd pass
will not be executed and the input will be rejected.
.SS Language Model (Finite State Grammar)
The recognition grammar can be specified in three ways: "-gram",
"-gramlist" or combination of "-dfa" and "-v".
.br
Multiple grammars can be specified by using "-gram" and "-gramlist".
When you use these options several times, all of them will be read at
startup.  Note that this is a different behavior from other options
(last one override previous ones).  You can use "-nogram" to reset
the already specified grammars at that point.
.Ip "\-gram gramprefix1[,gramprefix2[,gramprefix3,...]]"
Comma-separated list of grammars to be used.  the argument should be
prefix of a grammar, i.e. if you have "foo.dfa" and "foo.dict", 
you can specify them by single argument "foo".  Multiple grammars can
be specified as comma-separated list.
.Ip "\-gramlist listfile"
Specify a grammar list file that contains list of grammars to be used.
The list file should contain the prefixs of grammars, each per line.
A relative path in the list file will be treated as relative to the
list file, not the current path or configuration file.
.Ip "\-dfa dfa_filename"
Finite state automaton grammar file.
.Ip "\-v dictionary_file"
Word dictionary file (required)
.Ip "\-nogram"
Remove the current list of grammars already specified by the options above.
.Ip "\-penalty1 float"
Word insertion penalty for the first pass. (default: 0.0)
.Ip "\-penalty2 float"
Word insertion penalty for the second pass. (default: 0.0)
.Ip "\-spmodel {WORD|WORD[OUTSYM]|#num}"
Name of short pause model as defined in the hmmdefs.  In Julian, a
word whose pronunciation consists of only this short pause model is
called 'short pause word', and handled especially in recognition: even
if its appearance in a sentence is explicitly specified in the
grammar, it can be skipped while parsing.  This behavior is for
dealing with insertion and deletion of short pause that often appear
unintensionally in user utterances. 
They can be specified in a style as shown below (default: "sp").

.sp
     (Word_ID is the word position in the dictionary
      file starting from 0)
.Ip "\-forcedict"
Ignore dictionary errors and force running.  Words with errors will be
dropped from dictionary at startup.
.SS Acoustic Model (HMM)
.Ip "\-h hmmfilename"
HMM definition file to use. Format (ascii/binary) will be
automatically detected. (required)
.Ip "\-hlist HMMlistfilename"
HMMList file to use.  Required when using triphone based HMMs.
This file provides a mapping between the logical triphones names
genertated from the phonetic representation in the dictionary and the
HMM definition names.
.Ip "\-iwcd1 {best N|max|avg}"
When using a triphone model, select method to handle inter-word triphone
context on the first and last phone of a word in the first pass.
.sp
best N: use average likelihood of N-best scores from the same
        context triphones
.br
max: use maximum likelihood of the same
     context triphones
.br
avg: use average likelihood of the same
     context triphones (default)
.Ip "\-force_ccd / \-no_ccd "
Normally Julius determines whether the specified acoustic model is a
context-dependent model from the model names, i.e., whether the model
names contain character '+' and '-'.  You can explicitly specify by
these options to avoid mis-detection.  These will override the
automatic detection result.
.Ip "\-notypecheck"
Disable checking of the input parameter type. (default: enabled)
.SS Acoustic Computation
Gaussian Pruning will be automatically enabled when using
tied-mixture based acoutic model.  It is disabled by default
for non tied-mixture models, but you can activate pruning to those
models by explicitly specifying "\-gprune".  Gaussian Selection needs a
monophone model converted by 
.I mkgshmm.
.Ip "\-gprune {safe|heuristic|beam|none}"
Set the Gaussian pruning technique to use.
.br
(default: 'safe' (setup=standard), 'beam' (setup=fast) for tied mixture
model, 'none' for non tied-mixture model)
.Ip "\-tmix K"
With Gaussian Pruning, specify the number of Gaussians to compute per
mixture codebook. Small value will speed up computation,
but likelihood error will grow larger. (default: 2)
.Ip "\-gshmm hmmdefs"
Specify monophone hmmdefs to use for Gaussian Mixture Selectio.
Monophone model for GMS is generated from an ordinary monophone HMM
model using
.I mkgshmm.
This option is disabled by default. (no GMS applied)
.Ip "\-gsnum N"
When using GMS, specify number of monophone state to select from whole
monophone states. (default: 24)
.SS Inter-word Short Pause Handling
.Ip "\-iwsp"
(Multi-path version only) Enable inter-word context-free short pause
handling.  This option appends a skippable short pause model for every
word end.  The added model will be skipped on inter-word context
handling.  The HMM model to be appended can be specified by "-spmodel"
option. 
.SS Search Parameters (First Pass)
.Ip "\-b beamwidth"
Beam width (number of HMM nodes) on the first pass.  This value
defines search width on the 1st pass, and has great effect on the
total processing time.  Smaller width will speed up the decoding, but
too small value will result in a substantial increase of recognition
errors due to search failure.  Larger value will make the search
stable and will lead to failure-free search, but processing time and
memory usage will grow in proportion to the width.
.sp
default value: acoustic model dependent
  400 (monophone)
  800 (triphone,PTM)
 1000 (triphone,PTM, setup=v2.1)
.Ip "\-1pass"
Only perform the first pass search.
.Ip "\-realtime"
.Ip "\-norealtime"
Explicitly specify whether real-time (pipeline) processing will be
done in the first pass or not.  For file input, the default is OFF
(-norealtime), for microphone, adinnet and NetAudio input, the default
is ON (-realtime).  This option relates to the way CMN is performed:
when OFF, CMN is calculated for each input using cepstral mean of the
whole input.  When the realtime option is ON, MAP-CMN will be
performed.  When MAP-CMN, the cepstral mean of last 5 seconds are used
as the initial cepstral mean at the beginning of each input.  Also
refer to "\-progout".
.Ip "\-cmnsave filename"
Save last CMN parameters computed while recognition to the specified
file.  The parameters will be saved to the file in each time a input
is recognized, so the output file always keeps the last CMN
parameters.  If output file already exist, it will be overridden.
.Ip "\-cmnload filename"
Load initial CMN parameters previously saved in a file by "\-cmnsave".
Loading an initial CMN enables Julius to better recognize the first
utterance on a microphone / network input.  Also see "\-cmnnoupdate".
.Ip "\-cmnmapweight"
Specify weight of initial cepstral mean at the beginning of each
utterance for microphone / network input.  Specify larger value to
retain the initial cepstral mean for a longer period, and smaller
value to rely more on the current input.  (default: 100.0)
.Ip "\-cmnnoupdate"
When microphone / network input, this option makes engine not to
update the cepstral mean at each input and force engine to use the
initial cepstral mean given by "\-cmnload" parmanently.
.SS Search Parameters (Second Pass)
.Ip "\-b2 hyponum"
Beam width (number of hypothesis) in second pass.  If the count of
word expantion at a certain length of hypothesis reaches this limit
while search, shorter hypotheses are not expanded further.  This
prevents search to fall in breadth-first-like status stacking on the
same position, and improve search failure.  (default: 30)
.Ip "\-n candidatenum"
The search continues till 'candidate_num' sentence hypotheses have
been found.  The obtained sentence hypotheses are sorted by score, and
final result is displayed in the order (see also the "-output" option).
.sp
The possibility that the optimum hypothesis is correctly found
increases as this value gets increased, but the processing time also
becomes longer.
.sp
Default value depends on the  engine setup on compilation time:
.br
  10  (standard)
   1  (fast, v2.1)
.Ip "\-output N "
The top N sentence hypothesis will be Output at the end of search.
Use with "-n" option. (default: 1)
.Ip "\-cmalpha float"
This parameter decides smoothing effect of word confidence measure.
(default: 0.05)
.Ip "\-sb score"
Score envelope width for enveloped scoring.  When calculating
hypothesis score for each generated hypothesis, its trellis expansion
and viterbi operation will be pruned in the middle of the speech if
score on a frame goes under [current maximum score of the frame-
width].  Giving small value makes the second pass faster, but
computation error may occur.  (default: 80.0)
.Ip "\-s stack_size"
The maximum number of hypothesis that can be stored on the stack
during the search.  A larger value may give more stable results, but
increases the amount of memory required. (default: 500) 
.Ip "\-m overflow_pop_times"
Number of expanded hypotheses required to discontinue the search.  If
the number of expanded hypotheses is greater then this threshold then,
the search is discontinued at that point.  The larger this value is,
The longer Julius gets to give up search (default: 2000)
.Ip "\-lookuprange nframe"
When performing word expansion on the second pass, this option sets
the number of frames before and after to look up next word hypotheses
in the word trellis.  This prevents the omission of short words, but
with a large value, the number of expanded hypotheses increases and
system becomes slow. (default: 5)
.Ip "\-looktrellis"
Expand only the words survived on the first pass instead of expanding
all the words predicted by grammar.  This option makes second pass
decoding slightly faster especially for large vocabulary condition,
but may increase deletion error of short words. (default: disabled)
.SS Graph Output
.Ip "\-graphrange nframe"
When graph output is enabled (--enable-graphout), merge same words at
neighbor position.  If the position of same words differs smaller than
this value, they will be merged.  The default is 0 (allow merging on
exactly the same location) and specifying larger value will result in
smaller graph output.  Setting to -1 will disable merging, in that
case same words on the same location of different scores will be left
as they are. (default: 0)
.Ip "\-graphcut depth"
Cut the resulting graph by its word depth at post-processing stage.
The depth value is the number of words to be allowed at a frame.
Setting to -1 disables this feature. (default: 80)
.Ip "\-graphboundloop num"
Limit the number of boundary adjustment loop at post-processing
stage. This parameter prevents Julius from blocking by infinite 
adjustment loop by short word oscillation.  (default: 20)
.Ip "\-graphsearchdelay"
.Ip "\-nographsearchdelay"
When "-graphsearchdelay" option is set, Julius modifies its graph
generation alogrithm on the 2nd pass not to terminate search by graph
merging, until the first sentence candidate is found.
This option may improve graph accuracy, especially when you are going to
generate a huge word graph by setting broad search.  Namely, it may
result in better graph accuracy when you set wide beams on  both 1st
pass "-b" and 2nd pass "-b2", and large number for "-n".
(default: disabled)
.SS "Forced Alignment"
.Ip "\-walign"
Do viterbi alignment per word units from the recognition result.  The
word boundary frames and the average acoustic scores per frame are
calculated.
.Ip "\-palign"
Do viterbi alignment per phoneme (model) units from the recognition
result.  The phoneme boundary frames and the average acoustic scores per
frame are calculated.
.Ip "\-salign"
Do viterbi alignment per HMM state from the recognition result.  The
state boundary frames and the average acoustic scores per frame are
calculated.
.SS Server Module Mode
.Ip "\-module [port]"
Run Julian on "Server Module Mode".  After startup, Julian waits for
tcp/ip connection from client.  Once connection is established, Julian
start communication with the client to process incoming commands from
the client, or to output recognition results, input trigger
information and other system status to the client.  The multi-grammar
mode is only supported at this Server Module Mode.  The default port
number is 10500.
.I jcontrol
is sample client contained in this package.
.Ip "\-outcode [W][L][P][S][C][w][l][p][s]"
(Only for Server Module Mode) Switch which symbols of recognized words
to be sent to client.  Specify 'W' for output symbol, 'L' for grammar
entry, 'P' for phoneme sequence, 'S' for score, and 'C' for confidence
score, respectively.  Capital letters are for the second pass (final
result), and small letters are for results of the first pass.  For
example, if you want to send only the output symbols and phone
sequences as a recognition result to a client, specify "-outcode WP".
